<p class="hiking2">The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antartica.
Luckily,  there are much more accessible places if you'd like
to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to
this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude
above 55 Â° and low light pollution. Find your magentic latitude
on NOAA and here.
</p>

<p class="hiking2">In the polar latitudes, aurora can appear on any dark night.
Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time.
Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field
lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating
aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when
there are pleasant temperatures in the polar latitudes. Find the 
dark hours of your location here, or by using sky guide app.
